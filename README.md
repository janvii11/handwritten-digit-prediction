A real- time handwritten digit prediction project using python and OpenCV
Handwritten Digit Prediction - Real-Time Input

*Overview:*  
This project predicts handwritten digits in real-time using a webcam and a KNN model.

*Tools & Libraries:*  
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- joblib

*How to Run:*  
1. Make sure you have all libraries installed:
 pip install opencv-python numpy scikit-learn joblib
2.Run the code:
**Note:**
-KNN model will be trained automatically when you run the code for the first time.
-Make sure your training dataset path in the code is correct.
